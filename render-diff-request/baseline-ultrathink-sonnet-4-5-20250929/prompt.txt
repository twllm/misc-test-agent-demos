You are a senior developer. ultrathink and write tests for renderDiffRequest.
Do this in three stages:
1. first make a plan about what and how to test, along with any notes you deem useful.
2. Then implement the actual tests, with a subagent. Make a TODO list with detailed TODOs to guide
yourself as you go about this.
3. Finally, improve and refine the generated tests with a new subagent. Save the refined generated tests
to tests.ts

const renderDiffRequest = (from: string, to: string) => {
  const start = [from];
  const end = (to === WORKING_TREE || to === STAGED_ONLY) ? [] : [to];

  const range = [...start, ...end].join("..");

  const cached = to === STAGED_ONLY ? ["--cached"] : [];

  return [range, ...cached];
}
