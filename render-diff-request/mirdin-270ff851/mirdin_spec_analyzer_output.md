# Specification Analysis: renderDiffRequest

## Function Signature
```typescript
renderDiffRequest :: (from: string, to: string) -> string[]
```

## Purpose
Generates command-line arguments for a git diff operation based on two revision specifiers.

## Core Specification

### Behavioral Properties

```
renderDiffRequest(from, to) =
  let range = if (to == WORKING_TREE || to == STAGED_ONLY)
              then from
              else from ++ ".." ++ to
  in if (to == STAGED_ONLY)
     then [range, "--cached"]
     else [range]
```

In plain English:
1. **When `to` is a regular revision**: Returns `["${from}..${to}"]`
2. **When `to` is `WORKING_TREE`**: Returns `[from]`
3. **When `to` is `STAGED_ONLY`**: Returns `[from, "--cached"]`

### Key Ambiguities

1. **Undefined Constants**: The values of `WORKING_TREE` and `STAGED_ONLY` are not specified. These need to be defined as part of the interface contract.

2. **Input Validation**: The specification does not define behavior for:
   - Empty strings as inputs
   - Invalid git references
   - When `from` equals special constants

3. **Complete Set of Special Values**: Are `WORKING_TREE` and `STAGED_ONLY` the only special values, or could there be others?

## What is NOT Part of the Specification

The following are implementation details and should not be considered part of the public contract:
- Internal variable names (`start`, `end`, `range`, `cached`)
- The specific syntax for array construction (spread operators, concatenation order)
- The sequence of conditional evaluations

## Recommended Specification Improvements

To make this specification complete and unambiguous:

1. **Define the special constants explicitly**:
   ```typescript
   const WORKING_TREE = "WORKING_TREE";  // or actual value
   const STAGED_ONLY = "STAGED_ONLY";    // or actual value
   ```

2. **Specify the complete input domain**:
   ```typescript
   type Revision = string;
   type SpecialTarget = "WORKING_TREE" | "STAGED_ONLY";
   renderDiffRequest :: (from: Revision, to: Revision | SpecialTarget) -> string[]
   ```

3. **Define edge case behavior**: Document whether `from` can be a special constant and what happens with empty/invalid inputs.

## Test Coverage Implications

Essential test cases derived from the specification:
1. `to` is a regular revision → verify `["from..to"]`
2. `to === WORKING_TREE` → verify `[from]`
3. `to === STAGED_ONLY` → verify `[from, "--cached"]`
4. Any other special cases should be tested once ambiguities are resolved
